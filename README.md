# Audiobook Purchase Predictor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## INTRODUCTION
* Deep learning: One of the machine learning technique that learns features directly from data.
* Why deep learning: When the amounth of data is increased, machine learning techniques are insufficient in terms of performance and deep learning gives better performance like accuracy.

* What is amounth of big: It is hard to answer but intuitively 1 million sample is enough to say "big amounth of data"
* Usage fields of deep learning: Speech recognition, image classification, natural language procession (nlp) or recommendation systems
* What is difference of deep learning from machine learning:
Machine learning covers deep learning.
Features are given machine learning manually.
On the other hand, deep learning learns features directly from data.
