# Audiobook Repurchase Predictor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## INTRODUCTION
* Deep learning: One of the machine learning technique that learns features directly from data.
* Why deep learning: When the amounth of data is increased, machine learning techniques are insufficient in terms of performance and deep learning gives better performance like accuracy.

* What is amounth of big: It is hard to answer but intuitively 1 million sample is enough to say "big amounth of data"
* Usage fields of deep learning: Speech recognition, image classification, natural language procession (nlp) or recommendation systems
* What is difference of deep learning from machine learning:
Machine learning covers deep learning.
Features are given machine learning manually.
On the other hand, deep learning learns features directly from data.

## Project :
The Audiobook Repurchase Predictor is an AI-driven project designed to forecast whether a customer will make a repeat purchase of audiobooks. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the model processes historical customer data, balances the dataset, and standardizes inputs before training a neural network. The trained model achieves an accuracy of 81.70% on the test set, showcasing its proficiency in predicting customer repurchase behavior. This project aims to assist audiobook platforms in identifying and engaging customers likely to return, contributing to enhanced customer retention strategies.
